Basic helper functions for working with GitHub-flavored Markdown that I've found
useful in my day to day. 100% free-range Vimscript, and helps to alleviate the
nagging feeling that you need to pull in the entirety of an org-mode setup to
keep track of basic lists.

Check the function-level comments (under autoload/markdown) for more detailed
descriptions of the exact behavior and tradeoffs of each function. This is also
my first vim plugin of any kind, so if there is something that isn't idiomatic,
or is straight up wrong, please do feel free to file an issue!
